# Heart-on-your-sleeve
 Project for Superposition II hackathon. We wired a Flora circuitboard onto a t-shirt connected to an LED. The light has a button which the user can use to change based on mood. This project is helpful for people who want to express their feelings without words. For example, red would mean the user is in danger, blue would mean the user needed comfort, green would mean happy, etc. This project won for Best Social Good Hack.
